\begin{abstract}
Oracle Forms is no longer supported since 2008. The customer wants to do a migration of all these applications to a more modern .NET framework. The goals of the project are to have a single homogenous and flexible environment, obtain clean and transparent processes, and reduce complexity. During my internship with ELCA, as a member of the development team, my tasks are verifying the specifications in order to understand all the business and technical problem thoroughly; I also participated in developing the assigned modules, debugging the code; writing the unit test for the modules as well as providing necessary support to other team members.
