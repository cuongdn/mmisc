\chapter{Conclusion}
Many lessons are learnt and many skills are gained after the internship with ELCA. We found ourselves confident with the Oracle database immigration tasks. The performance and security of the system are not violated despite of the high volume of data accessed. It is our chance to work with queries, system optimizations in a large scale system. This achievement is done via the right choice of technology as well as the well-designed and extensible architecture with an experienced team. We also learnt the rich library with its advantages not only in current projects but future applications.

Moreover, I personally and as a team member successfully developed six modules within the deadline.  The rich content of the distributed systems, OOP, architecture design, and advanced database helped me a lot in my internship period.  I also gained new knowledge and skill in CSLA, NHibernate and Oracle. The experience in system analysis, database design, architecture design, and data manipulation must also be counted into my achievements. 
\par
Thanks to ELCA to provide me the professional international environment. In the future, I might apply quickly to other high level projects. Not only technical skills but also soft skills such as time management, team work, and project management are all embedded into the internship period.
